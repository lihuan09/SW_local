# SW_local

# This program is to implement the Smith-Watermen local alighmnet algorithm for protein sequences.

# The dependecies are including argparse, pandas, and numpy

# blosum62.txt is provided as the score matrix for match and mismatch

# The default gap penalities are as follows: openning gap = -2, extension gap = -1

# There are two sample input and output files 

# Please follow the instructions to run the program

# Usage: python hw1.py -i <input file> -s <score file>
# Example: python hw1.py -i input.txt -s blosum62.txt
